# WWDC19 Scholarship Submission - Sand Castle [SUBMITTED]
Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVYPdaOCv_4
### Third party resource used:
Library and source code:
- DCExplosion by Tangdixi (https://bit.ly/2YlE4Tc), this is an open source library to provide an explosive effect to the view. I use this library because it can represent collapsed sand. I made several modification & update deprecated code.

Sound effects:

- Music background: Bavarian Beach Bar by Lobo Loco (https://bit.ly/2WhRFJC), this guy has great work! The music is represented joyful emotion in the beach, so I trim it to 29 sec then use it as main background sound.
- Sound of falling sand: Sand Falling on Paper by Mwmarsh (httpis://bit.ly/2YggLu2), this sound represents the effect of falling sand when you tap twice into the castle part in the game.
- Collected Crab: Itemize by Scrampunk (https://bit.ly/2U62T6q), this sound used to represent item/point collected when you tap into the crab in the game.
- Sound Alarm: Alarm Clock by Joe Deshon (https://bit.ly/2HB7TdE), when the time to build the sand castle is complete the user will warn by the alarm sound and view, it makes the world game feel real and engage user emotions.
- Touch sound by Joshua Wisjnu, he is my friend from the apple academy in Indonesia. We are in the same team at mini challenge 2. We create a game to teach kids about tempo. because this touch sound is awesome so I ask him to use this sound. He created this sound using Garageband.
- And the last one, I captured the image of WWDC 2019 from Apple WWDC website developer.apple.com/wwdc19 for the closing screen. It‚Äôs motivated me and I hope I can meet with other scholarship recipients from over the world!

Images or Graphic:
- I‚Äôm not a designer actually üòÖ, I‚Äôm a coder. But I read carefully all of the terms and conditions, then I found, this is an ‚Äúindividual work‚Äù not a ‚Äúgroup work‚Äù that‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt ask people to help me. So I learned how to use Sketch on my Macbook and Voila! I created every image asset by my self!
